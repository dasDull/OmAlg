# OmAlg
Toolkit for the algebraic theory of omega-automata.
# Implemented features
* transform automata into equivalent omega semigroups (B端chi's construction). Supported types: 
    * Deterministic:    Buechi, coBuechi, parity
    * Nondeterministic: Buechi, coBuechi

# Currently working on
* fixing bugs, translation from more kinds of automata to omega-semigroups.

# Planned features
- user manual
- omega-semigroups to parity automata
- decide a language L's position in the Landweber hierarchy given an omega-semigroup for L
- omega-semigroups to weak B端chi automata
- omega-semigroups to deterministic B端chi and co-B端chi automata
