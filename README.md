Toolkit for the algebraic theory of omega-automata
# Implemented features
None yet!
# Currently working on
- translation from B端chi automata to omega-semigroups

# Planned features
- omega-semigroups to parity automata
- decide a language L's position in the Landweber hierarchy given an omega-semigroup for L
- omega-semigroups to weak B端chi automata
- omega-semigroups to deterministic B端chi and co-B端chi automata
