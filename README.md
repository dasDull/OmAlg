# OmAlg
Toolkit for the algebraic theory of omega-automata.
The file manual.pdf contains a comprehensive user manual including installation guide and examples.

# Implemented features
* transform automata into equivalent omega semigroups (Buechi's construction). Supported types:
    * Deterministic:    Buechi, coBuechi, parity, Muller
    * Nondeterministic: Buechi, coBuechi
* decide a language L's position in the Landweber hierarchy given an omega-semigroup for L
* transform omega-semigroups into equivalent automata (if applicable). Supported types:
    * parity automata (Colcombet's construction)
    * deterministic Buechi and coBuechi automata
    * weak Buechi automata

# Currently working on
- user manual

# Planned features
-  reduce omega semigroups to syntactic omega semigroups
